            This NFT User License (this “User License”) constitutes a legally binding agreement between you and Friends Of The Future and governs your use of any non-fungible token purchased or obtained on update website link (the “Site”) or which you have subsequently acquired in accordance with the terms of this User License.

            Upon purchasing or otherwise legally acquiring one or more non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and agreeing to this license, as well as subject to your continued compliance with this User License and the Terms of Service, you will gain legal ownership, rights, and title to the applicable NFTs. These NFTs are associated with certain metadata, artwork, graphics, images, designs, logos, drawings, photographs, text, taglines, or video or audio recordings (collectively, “Metadata”). <br /> <br />
            You acknowledge that owning NFTs may grant you the right to view, store, exchange, and publicly display the NFT, but it does not confer commercial use rights or ownership rights over the Metadata. The intellectual property rights in the NFTs and associated Metadata are retained by "Friends of the Future."

          <div className="point-desc pb-4">
            <span style={{ fontWeight: "500" }}>Personal Use.</span> Upon purchasing or otherwise legally obtaining one or more NFTs and agreeing to this license, and subject to your continued compliance with this User License and the Terms of Service, Friends of the Future grants you a limited, worldwide, non-assignable, sublicensable, non-transferable (except as permitted in Section 2(c) below) license for the personal, non-commercial use and display of the Metadata associated with the applicable NFT legally owned and properly obtained by you. The Metadata may only be used as part of the NFT in accordance with the foregoing license as follows: (i) use of the Metadata on a marketplace that allows the purchase and sale of the NFT, so long as the marketplace cryptographically verifies that you are the owner; and (ii) use of the Metadata on the Site or a third-party website or app that allows the inclusion, involvement, or participation of the Metadata, so long as the website/app cryptographically verifies that you are the owner, and the Metadata does not stay on the website/app after you have left. <br /> <br />
            <span style={{ fontWeight: "500" }}>Commercial use.</span> Upon purchasing or otherwise legally obtaining one or more NFTs and agreeing to this license, and subject to your continued compliance with this User License and the Terms of Service, Friends of the Future grants you a limited, worldwide, royalty-free, non-assignable, sublicensable, non-transferable (except as permitted in Section 2(c) below) license to use, copy, and display the Metadata associated with the applicable NFT legally owned and properly obtained by you for the purposes of creating derivative works based on the Metadata (“Commercial Use”). Examples of permissible Commercial Use would be, e.g., the use of the Metadata to produce and sell physical merchandise (i.e., T-Shirts, etc.) displaying copies of the Metadata. For the sake of clarity, nothing in this Section will be deemed to restrict you from (i) owning or operating a marketplace that permits the use and sale of NFTs generally, provided that the marketplace cryptographically verifies each NFT owner’s rights to display the Metadata for their NFT to ensure that only the actual owner can display the Metadata; (ii) owning or operating a third-party website or application that permits the inclusion, involvement, or participation of an NFT generally, provided that the third-party website or application cryptographically verifies each NFT owner’s rights to display the Metadata for their NFT to ensure that only the actual owner can display the Metadata, and provided that the Metadata is no longer visible once the owner of the NFT leaves the website/application; or (iii) earning revenue from any of the foregoing. <br /> <br />
            <span style={{ fontWeight: "500" }}>Permissible Transfers of Your Licensed Rights.</span> You have the limited right to assign or transfer your licensed rights (a “transfer”), as described in Section 2(a) and 2(b) and in accordance with this Section 2(c) in connection with the sale, trade, donation, transfer, or other disposition of your NFT for any reason, provided that: (i) the transferee is not (x) located in a country that is subject to a U.S. Government embargo, or has been designated by the U.S. Government as a "terrorist-supporting" country, or (y) listed on any U.S. Government list of prohibited or restricted parties (a “Prohibited Transferee”); (ii) the transferee accepts all of the terms of this User License and the Terms of Service; (iii) you have not, prior to the transfer or assignment, breached this User License or the Terms of Service; and (iv) prior to the transfer or assignment, your licensed rights have not been terminated. Any attempted transfer or assignment of your licensed rights that does not satisfy the requirements of this Section 2(c) shall be null and void and shall constitute a material breach of this User License. <br /> <br />
            <span style={{ fontWeight: "500" }}>Commissions.</span> You acknowledge and agree that you may be charged a commission when you sell NFTs originally purchased or acquired via the Site on certain Secondary Marketplaces and that such commission may be payable in whole or in part to Friends of the Future.

            (x) Procure for you the right to continue using such Metadata, or <br />
            (y) Replace the Metadata so that such materials become non-infringing. <br /> <br />

            <span style={{ fontWeight: "500" }}>You acknowledge and agree as follows:</span> <br />
            (i) There are risks associated with blockchain-based assets like the NFTs, including, but not limited to, the volatility of price and the absence of liquidity (the ability to resell), the risk of loss of your NFT as a result of faulty hardware, software, and Internet connections and/or failures; the risk of the introduction of malicious software; the risk that third parties may obtain unauthorized access to information stored within the wallet holding your NFT; and the risk of loss of your NFT due to loss of private key(s), custodial error, or purchaser error. Friends of the Future will not be responsible for any of these, however caused. <br />
            (ii) We do not make any representations, warranties, promises, or guarantees, express or implied, about the availability of any NFTs or Metadata on the Internet. <br />
            (iii) Upgrades to the Site or the Relevant Network, a hard fork in the Relevant Network, a failure or cessation of the Relevant Network, or a change in how transactions are confirmed on the Relevant Network all may have unintended, adverse effects on the NFTs. <br />
            (iv) The NFTs (including the Metadata) are made available solely for collection and entertainment purposes. <br />
            (v) We do not make any representations, warranties, promises, or guarantees, express or implied, related to any third parties you interact with or their applications and/or services, including but not limited to the continued availability of either and/or the protection and/or storage of any data you provide to those parties. <br />
            (vi) There also exists the risk of hacking, security weaknesses, fraud, counterfeiting, cyberattacks, and other technological difficulties; the risk of changes to the regulatory regime governing blockchain technologies, cryptocurrencies, and tokens, and new regulations or unfavorable regulatory intervention in one or more jurisdictions or policies, any of which may materially adversely affect the use and value of any NFT; and the risks related to taxation. <br /> <br />
            In addition to assuming all of the above risks, you acknowledge that we cannot and do not represent or warrant that any NFT, or its supporting systems or technology, is reliable, current, or error-free, meets your requirements, or that defects in any NFT, or its supporting systems or technology, will be corrected. We cannot and do not represent or warrant that any NFT or the delivery mechanism for it is free of viruses or other harmful components. Transactions in NFTs are irreversible, and, accordingly, losses due to fraudulent or accidental transactions may not be recoverable. You accept and acknowledge that we will not be responsible for any communication failures, disruptions, errors, distortions, or delays you may experience related to any NFT. If the Metadata associated with an NFT is no longer maintained at the storage location indicated in the resource locator contained in the NFT, the market value of such NFT may be reduced or eliminated entirely.
