                    <div className="point-desc pb-4">Register. To participate in Releases and purchase NFTs, you will first need to register on the Site. To register, you may be required to provide an email address and to be authenticated by clicking on a link sent to the email address provided. <br /> <br />

                        Connecting a Wallet. To purchase NFTs on the Site, you will need to use a supported third-party wallet application (a “Wallet”), such as your MetaMask wallet, which will enable you to purchase and store NFTs. <br /> <br />

                        Purchasing NFTs Generally. The Site allows you to purchase NFTs and display the related Metadata. NFTs will be initially sold via the Site, and you may purchase NFTs directly from us using certain digital assets for payment. In the event that sales of NFTs are sold via one or more modified auction processes (each, an “Auction”), you agree to abide by all rules and regulations in place for each Auction. Any payments or financial or other transactions, including transfers of NFTs from one public address on the Relevant Network to another address on the Relevant Network, that you engage in via the Site will be conducted either through the Relevant Network (in the case of transfers of NFTs) or through a third-party service provider, subject to the terms below. We have no control over these payments or transactions, nor do we have the ability to reverse any payments or transactions once made. Payments for NFTs processed through third-party partners will be subject to separate terms and conditions, if any, associated with the use of those third-party services. We have no liability to you or to any third party for any claims or damages that may arise as a result of any payments or transactions that you engage in via the Site, or any other payment or transactions that you conduct via the Relevant Network. <br /> <br />

                        Secondary Transactions. NFTs purchased on the Site may be purchased, sold, and traded on third-party NFT marketplaces (“Secondary Marketplaces”) that support NFTs. Secondary transactions on any such Secondary Marketplaces will be subject to the terms and conditions of such marketplaces. We will not be a party to any secondary transaction on any Secondary Marketplace. NFTs may not be compatible with all Secondary Marketplaces, and we make no guarantee about the availability or functionality of any Secondary Marketplace. <br /> <br />

                        Commissions. Secondary transactions through Secondary Marketplaces involving NFTs created by us may be subject to a commission (a “Commission”) or other charge payable to us. Any such Commission will be specified in the User License.
                        <br /> <br />
                        OTHER THAN OUR OBLIGATIONS SET OUT IN THESE TERMS, YOU AGREE THAT WE:
                        Are not liable to you for the accuracy of any information posted on the Site by a User, or any failure by a User to comply with these Terms or any other legal obligation;
                        Have not made, and do not make any representation, guarantee, or warranty that any NFT will meet your requirements or expectations; <br /> <br />
                        Are not liable or responsible for any increase or decrease in value of any NFT;
                        Have not made, and do not make, any promises (whether explicit, implied, or otherwise) as to the value of any NFT, including whether the value of the NFT will increase or decrease in the future; and
                        Will not be responsible for the negligence or misconduct of other Users. <br /> <br />

                        By accessing the Site, you acknowledge that the prices of collectible assets in general and NFTs in particular are volatile and subjective, and that we cannot guarantee that any NFTs purchased through the Site will retain any value, which may depend on a number of inherently subjective factors beyond our or their control, including the desirability of a particular NFT. <br /> <br />

                        Transaction Fees. Every transaction executed through the Site requires the payment of a Relevant Network transaction fee payable in the native digital asset of the Relevant Network (each, a “Transaction Fee”). Except as otherwise expressly set forth in these Terms, you will be solely responsible to pay any Transaction Fee for any transaction that you initiate through the Site. <br /> <br />

                        Your Responsibility for Taxes. You will be solely responsible to pay any and all sales, use, value-added, and other taxes, duties, and assessments (except taxes on our net income) now or hereafter claimed or imposed by any governmental authority (collectively, “Taxes”) associated with transactions executed by you through the Site. Except for income taxes levied on us, you will pay or reimburse us for all national, federal, state, local, or other taxes and assessments of any jurisdiction, including value-added taxes and taxes as required by international tax treaties, customs or other import or export taxes, and amounts levied in lieu thereof based on charges set, services performed, or payments made hereunder, as are now or hereafter may be imposed under the authority of any national, state, local, or any other taxing jurisdiction. <br /> <br />

                        Assumption of Risk. You acknowledge and agree as follows: (i) there are risks associated with blockchain-based assets like the NFTs, including, but not limited to, the volatility of price and the absence of liquidity (the ability to resell), the risk of loss of your NFT as a result of faulty hardware, software, and Internet connections and/or failures; the risk of the introduction of malicious software; the risk that third parties may obtain unauthorized access to information stored within the wallet holding your NFT; and the risk of loss of your NFT due to loss of private key(s), custodial error, or purchaser error, and we will not be responsible for any of these, however caused; (ii) we do not make any representations, warranties, promises, or guarantees, express or implied, about the availability of any NFTs on the Internet; (iii) upgrades to the Site, or the Relevant Network, a Fork in the Relevant Network, a failure or cessation of the Relevant Network, or a change in how transactions are confirmed on the Relevant Network all may have unintended, adverse effects on the NFTs; (iv) the NFTs are made available solely for collection and entertainment purposes; (v) we do not make any representations, warranties, promises, or guarantees, express or implied, related to any third parties you interact with or their applications and/or services, including but not limited to the continued availability of either and/or the protection and/or storage of any data you provide to those parties; (vi) there also exists: (a) the risk of hacking, security weaknesses, fraud, counterfeiting, cyberattacks, and other technological difficulties; (b) the risk of changes to the regulatory regime governing blockchain technologies, cryptocurrencies, and tokens and new regulations, or unfavorable regulatory intervention in one or more jurisdictions or policies any of which may materially adversely affect the use and value of any NFT; and (c) the risks related to taxation. In addition to assuming all of the above risks, you acknowledge that we cannot and do not represent or warrant that any NFT, or its supporting systems or technology, is reliable, current, or error-free, meets your requirements, or that defects in any NFT, or its supporting systems or technology, will be corrected. We cannot and do not represent or warrant that any NFT or the delivery mechanism for it is free of viruses or other harmful components. Transactions in NFTs are irreversible, and, accordingly, losses due to fraudulent or accidental transactions may not be recoverable. You accept and acknowledge that we will not be responsible for any communication failures, disruptions, errors, distortions, or delays you may experience related to any NFT. If the Metadata associated with an NFT is no longer maintained at the storage location indicated in the URI contained in the NFT, the market value of such NFT may be reduced or eliminated entirely.

                    <div className="point-head py-4">12. DISPUTE RESOLUTION</div>
                    <div className="point-desc pb-4">Pre-Arbitration Dispute Resolution: We aim to resolve disputes amicably and efficiently. Most concerns can be resolved quickly to the customer’s satisfaction by contacting our customer support. A Notice must describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute and the specific relief sought. If unresolved within sixty (60) days after receipt, an arbitration proceeding may be commenced. Settlement offers shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the determination of the amount, if any, to which you or we are entitled. <br /> <br />

                        Arbitration Agreement and Procedures: Disputes will be resolved by binding arbitration, as an alternative to court action. The American Arbitration Association ("AAA") under its rules, including the AAA’s Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes, will conduct arbitration. We will pay all arbitration fees if they are deemed excessive. The arbitration may be conducted in person, by document submission, by phone, or online. The arbitrator's decision will be final and binding, with limited exceptions. Arbitration will take place in [Your Location], unless otherwise mutually agreed. <br /> <br />
